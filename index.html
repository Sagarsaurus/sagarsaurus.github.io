        <p align="center">Hey everyone, my name is Sagar.</p>

        Here are some interesting facts about me:
        <ul>
            <li>I am a senior (citizen) here at Georgia Tech and will be (hopefully) graduating in May.</li>
            <li>I can solve a Rubik's Cube in a little under 20 seconds on average.</li>
            <li>I have been a TA since my third semester here and TA'd CS 1331, Physics 2, and now I TA CS 2200.</li>
            <li>I have been missing classes left and right because of interviews (including this one, sorry professor), but I finally got an offer from Oracle!</li>
        </ul>
