        <p align="center">Hey everyone, my name is Sagar. I am a current CS major and hoping to work in the Bay Area after graduating.  I had never done any programming before I came to Georgia Tech but now that I have, I am glad that I did.  I was always good at thinking logically, solved the Rubik's Cube, was in some math competitions, but I never realized that computing was the same thing except and was also a profession.  I have enjoyed my time here and have worked as a TA for numerous classes, not always in the CS department, and have also tutored quite a few courses.  I have been out of town a lot lately, primarily for interviews.  But, I think I finally secured a job that I am proud of with Oracle in the Bay Area.</p>

        Here are some interesting facts about me / some of my hobbies:
        <ol>
            <li>I am a senior (citizen) here at Georgia Tech and will be (hopefully) graduating in May.  My two Threads are Intelligence and Info Internetworks.</li>
            <li>I can solve a Rubik's Cube in a little under 20 seconds on average.</li>
            <li>I have been a TA since my third semester here and TA'd CS 1331, Physics 2, and now I TA CS 2200.</li>
            <li>I have been missing classes left and right because of interviews (including this one, sorry professor), but I finally got an offer from Oracle!</li>
            <li>I love playing Soccer and Table Tennis.  If you're looking to play let me know!</li>
            <li>CS is by far my favorite subject at this school.  On the contrary, THWh (To Hell With humanities).</li>
            <li>I love helping people, which is why being a TA is something that I love.</li>
            <li>Learning and doing: those are my two main passions in life.  I love learning new things and using the things that I learned to build something incredible.  This is why I love hackathons.</li>
